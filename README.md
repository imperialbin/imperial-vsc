- `Expiration`: An integer of days, of how long to keep the paste before expiration.
- `Instant Delete`: Deletes the paste after the first view from a human.
- `Image Embed`: View the code uploaded as an image, instead of text in the embed.
- `Longer URLS`: Have longer URLS

### Keybinds

### Extension

- `Imperial.uploadDocument`: Uploads the selected text to Imperial and responds with a URL of your document.

## Requirements

while these should come preinstalled with the extension, every system is different. If you face any troubles, try installing/resintalling these first.
